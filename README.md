# Matrix-Vector

This code was written for my object-oriented programming class in C++ taken Fall of 2024! I was instructed to implement two versions of a function that multiplies an integer matrix of by an integer vector, returning a integer vector as a result. One had to be done with the use of iterators, and the other in using indexing to access elements.
